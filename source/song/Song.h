// THE SONG TRACK (PR7-D 0.8.0, plan stage d, the song track part 1): grooves laid out as a song. Our own design,
// inspired by the song track of commercial drum software (chapter 7 of the manual the owner sent): blocks, each a
// groove copied in (its notes already as the kit's drums), placed bar by bar, played with the DAW's song position.
//
// Placing (our rule): a block dropped inside another goes before or after it (the nearer edge), and the blocks after it
// move along to make room, so nothing overlaps and nothing is cut; dropped past the end it stays where it's dropped (a
// gap before it). Lengthening a block pushes the ones after it; shortening leaves a gap.
