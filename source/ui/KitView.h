// THE KIT VIEW (0.14.0): the kit drawn from the drummer's seat, on DRUMS. It's a 3D scene of our own design in the
// family's colours (black drums lit by their own glowing rings, pink on the hi-hat's side through red to orange on
// the ride's), rendered once into pictures that are built into the plugin:
//   - the kit as it sits (KitImages::kit_jpg);
//   - each of its 12 pieces glowing brighter, cut to the area it changes (lit-<piece>.png, with an alpha that fades
//     where the glow fades, so a piece fades in over the kit with no seam), and where each cut goes (kitlayout.txt);
//   - a click map (kitzones.png): each clickable part in its own value, the slot it plays + 1 (0: nothing). The snare's
//     head is SD, its hoop SD2 (the rimshot), its shell RIM (the sidestick); the ride's bow RD, its bell RB; the
//     hi-hat CH, its pedal PH. The clap and the shaker have no piece.
// Click a piece to choose its drum and hear it (as its row does; SHIFT / CTRL choose several, as on the rows). Each
// piece glows brighter as it plays, fading with its hit over its first second; the chosen drum's piece glows a little.
