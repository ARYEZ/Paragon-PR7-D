// THE SAMPLE ENGINE (PR7-D 0.19.0): a drum played from many recorded hits, as drum software plays its sampled kits
// (inspired by its velocity layers, round-robins and "hit variation"; our own design and code). Never their sounds:
// the user's own samples, from SFZ files (an open, plain-text format many multi-sampled drum kits come in) or from a
// folder of hits.
//
//   - VELOCITY LAYERS: the hits recorded at one loudness, for a range of velocities (soft hits for soft notes...).
//   - ROUND-ROBINS: several hits per layer, so repeated notes don't play the very same sound (the "machine gun").
//   - Each hit may come from several files at once (an SFZ kit's microphones: close, overheads, room); in 0.19.0
//     they're summed into one stereo hit as it loads (each file's own level and pan), as the kit's full mix. 0.20.0
//     will keep them apart, as mic channels.
//
// Choosing a hit (Instrument::choose, on the audio thread, nothing allocated):
//   - the layer for the velocity (or the nearest);
//   - ADJACENT LAYERS: a velocity in the upper or lower part of its layer may take a hit from the layer next to it
//     that way, its level matched to this layer's;
//   - RANDOMIZE: a random hit, never the one just played (off: each in turn);
//   - LAYER LIMIT: only the first N hits of each layer (0: all).
// Velocity to volume (whether a softer note within a layer also plays quieter) is the kit's business (Kit::startHit).
