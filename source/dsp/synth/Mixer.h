// THE MIXER'S MIC CHANNELS (PR7-D 0.20.0): a multi-mic kit's drums recorded through several microphones (close mics on
// each drum, overheads and room mics over the kit) play each mic's recording through its own channel, as a sampled
// drum kit's mixer does (inspired by the reference's mixer chapter; our own channels, names and design). Only drums
// from multi-mic kits use them; synth drums and single samples go their own way as before.
//
// The channels are fixed, so a kit's mics are sorted into them by name (our own rules, from the words the files and
// SFZ labels use: "kick in", "OH", "room"...). A mic a channel's own drum is close to is DIRECT sound there; another
// drum heard through it is BLEED (the snare in the kick mic). Overheads, room and ambience hear the whole kit, so
// nothing is bleed there.
