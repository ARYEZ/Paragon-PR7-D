// THE NOTE MAP (PR7-D 0.2.0): which MIDI note plays which drum.
//
//   ROOT          the 23 keys from ROOT play the slots in order (C the kick ... the first 12 as on General MIDI kits'
//                 octave, as PR7-K played them); the four keys under ROOT start the sequencer's patterns on KEY.
//   GROOVE LIBRARY  the extended layout of popular drum software's groove libraries, so their MIDI grooves play as
//                 written: several notes per drum (its articulations), from note 1 to 127. Inspired by that layout,
//                 checked against the owner's copy of one maker's published map and an open-source drum-map table;
//                 our own reading where they're silent (which ride notes are bow, bell or edge).
//   GENERAL MIDI  the General MIDI percussion map (35 to 81).
//   CUSTOM        the player's own, edited note by note (and saved as their default).
//
// Notes a layout doesn't use play nothing.
