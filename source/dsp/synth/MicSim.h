// SIMULATED MICS AND ROOM (PR7-D 0.26.0): a synth drum (or a single sample) heard the way a recorded kit is, through
// close mics, a pair of overheads, a room pair and a far ambience pair, each with the delay and level its distance
// from the drum gives, the other drums bleeding into each close mic (quieter and duller off the mic's axis), and a
// modelled room behind the room and ambience mics. Each mic plays into THE MIXER's channel for it, so the mixer's
// faders, bleed, sends, effects and routing work on synth drums as on a multi-mic sampled kit.
//
// Our own design: the kit's layout (where each piece and mic stands, in metres from the drummer's seat, right-handed:
// the hi-hat on the left) is ours, levels fall with distance (1 / d), sound arrives at 343 m/s, and each mic channel
// has a fixed colour of our choosing (the kick-in mic's click, the kick-out's boom...). The room is a feedback delay
// network (8 lines) with early reflections. Nothing in it is measured from a real room or microphone.
