// THE DRUMS (PR7-K's stage 6a): a kit of slots, the first 12 one per key of an octave (C the kick, D# the clap, as on
// Avenger's drum tab and General MIDI); PR7-D 0.2.0 added 8 more (rides, more cymbals, a half-open hat, tambourine and
// shaker). Which keys play which slot is the note map's business (NoteMap.h). Each slot is one of our own drum synths or a sample the user loads; they play as one-shots (a
// note-off doesn't stop them), with VOLUME, PAN, PITCH, and three shaping knobs whose meaning suits the model:
//
//   DECAY  how long it rings;
//   TONE   its brightness (or, on KICK and TOM, how far the pitch drops);
//   SNAP   its attack (the beater's click, the snare's wires, the hats' sizzle...).
//
// The drum synths are our own designs from the classic analog ideas: a sine whose pitch falls (kick, tom), tuned modes
// plus filtered noise (snare), noise in bursts (clap), six square waves at unrelated pitches for metal (hats, cymbal,
// cowbell). Not a copy of any drum machine's circuit. SAMPLE plays the slot's sample (cubic interpolation, any rate);
// its DECAY, TONE and SNAP are neutral at the middle: DECAY under it shortens the sample, TONE tilts it darker or
// thinner, SNAP softens the attack or adds a spike.
//
// CHOKE: a hit stops the other slots in its group (the closed hat stops the open hat). MUTE and SOLO as on a mixer.
