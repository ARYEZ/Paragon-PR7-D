// DRUMGIZMO KITS (PR7-D 0.27.0): multi-mic drum kits in the open DrumGizmo format (drumgizmo.org), read from where the
// user unzipped them. Free kits recorded in real studios come in it (the CrocellKit, a metal kit, CC-BY 4.0; the
// DRSKit, the MuldjordKit...); we never ship their audio: the user downloads a kit, PR7-D loads it.
//
// The format (as the kits' own files show it): a kit file (<drumkit>, e.g. "CrocellKit_full.xml") lists the mic
// channels and the instruments (each its own file); an instrument file lists its hits (<sample power="...">), each hit
// one multichannel WAV with a file channel per mic (<audiofile channel="SnareTop" file="..." filechannel="13"/>).
// "power" is how hard it was hit (the kit's own measure: higher is harder). A midimap file next to the kit file
// ("Midimap_full.xml" for "<Kit>_full.xml") gives each instrument its MIDI note.
//
// Here (our own design):
//   - a hit's mics go into THE MIXER's channels by their names (KDrumInside: KICK IN, OHLeft / OHRight: OVERHEADS'
//     sides, OHCenter: both, AmbLeft / AmbRight: ROOM...), a left / right pair into one stereo mic;
//   - the hits, sorted by power, are shared out into velocity layers, each layer's velocities from its hits' power
//     (on a log scale between the softest and the hardest), each layer's hits its round-robins;
//   - LIGHT (the default): up to 8 layers of 2 hits, each hit at most 4.5 s long (cymbals 5 s in 6 layers; tails faded out), the mics
//     that only hear it as bleed (another drum's close mic) at most 1 s, mics that hardly hear it at all left out; so a
//     whole kit fits in well under a gigabyte of memory. FULL: every hit, every mic, at full length (the CrocellKit:
//     about 6 GB).
